# VSOC-Landing-Page
A landing page depiction a make-believe product called VSOC (Virtual Seed of Creation)

Description:
This is a first-time project made to showcase what I've learned studying HTML and CSS on my own. The information within this project are all pretend and should not be taken seriously. Though I have put in effort to try to recreate a real product to showcase on a landing page. It's a simple and open style where sections are divided by images which are suppose to invoke certain emotions and create relations between the customers and the product.

Features:
- Fixed navbar
- Use of flexbox for organization
- Links in navbar that corresponds to relative sections
- Use of certain selectors to apply styles to without using classes or ids
- Classes and ids to apply styles too
- Embedded video
- Use of typography to add in small details
